Why flatlist?
Flatlist has lots of features.
we can add header footer in the list.

When there are more element, flat list manages the items in a convinient way.
it will remove the element from top and bottom views in order to make the scroll
work smoothly.

If we had used map function, it will not remove as it is the core function/feature of js.
If our mobile phone is of low feature, then we will face issues while using scroll and others.

So, flatlist will be convinient to use at that time. We can also use lazy loading with flatlist which 
cant be use with the map(will require an extra logics)
